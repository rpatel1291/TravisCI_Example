# Week 2
## Objective

### Assignment 2a

Part 1:

    Review the Triangle.py file which includes the classifyTriangle() function implemented in Python.  
    Enhance the set of test cases for the Triangle problem that adequately tests the classifyTriangle() function to find problems.  The test cases will be in a separate test program file called TestTriangle.py .  You should not fix any bugs in Triangle.py at this time, just make changes to TestTriangle.py
    Run your test set against the classifyTriangle() function by running:
        python -m unittest TestTriangle
    Create a test report in the format specified below.  This report shows the results of testing the initial classifyTriangle() implementation.
    Commit and push your changes to the TestTriangle.py program to GitHub

Part 2:

    After you've completed part 1 that defines your test set and after running it against the buggy classifyTriangle() function, update the logic in classifytTriangle() to fix all of the logic bugs you found by code inspection and with your test cases.
    Run the same test set on your improved classifyTriangle() function and create a test report on your improved logic
    Commit and push your changes to the Triangle.py program to GitHub
